# whereami v2

## What is this
Eventually, a nodejs re-write of a geotracking app for people who WANT to be found. The original whereami was a great way to publish your trackable location so others could see where you were, anonymously. But it was based on a lot of Laravel overhead.

## What's going to be better?
- Server in nodejs, rather than laravel
- Clients in Flutter (or, ReactNative if I have to), instead of Objective-C / Java
- Full API, so that third parties can use the platform to publish their people to locate, and integrate that into their own services.

## Who made this?
James Perih, previously of Hot Dang Interactive (well... maybe Hot Dang will live on forever), but now (c) 2020 Four And A Half Giraffes, Ltd.
